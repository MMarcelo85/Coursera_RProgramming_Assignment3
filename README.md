# Coursera_RProgramming_Assignment3
My solution to the last Assignment  of Coursera's RProgramming

In this repository you can find the three files that you need to complete the last Assignment of Coursera's R Programming by John Hopkins University. 

I strongly recommend to you to use this files as a last resource, to see if tou can get any insight about your own solution. I did get through this assignment by myself, with very little previuos experiencie but with real engagment and googleing on how to do some of the steps needed for the functions. If you don `t get frustrated and try things out, you are going to get it right.

Also I want to recomend a great tutorial on this Assignment. I didn't took that aproach but it did help me to clear some things.

I included a function which searchs for needed packages in the function, it loads the packages or install and load if they are not found. Credits to this guy:

The 3 functions have room for improvement indeed, I am just starting programming in R, specially rankhospital.R and rankall.R  

Hope this could help you!
Cheers!
